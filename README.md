Manage Client-Side Libraries opens libman.json not UI Dialog
The dialog is accessed by right-clicking on a folder and choosing Add->Client Side Library...

The "Manage Client-Side Libraries" command opens libman.json to allow you to remove or change versions. When you save the file, LibMan will automatically update the downloaded files.

We understand that this is a little confusing, so we'll keep this item open to review the UX for the feature.
